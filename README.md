👋 Hi, I’m @natalia-armstrong, but you can call me Nate (or Armstrong if you want to make me happy).  

- 👀 I’m interested in coding, reading, listening to music, singing, playing guitar, games, Lord of the Rings (my all-time favorite fantasy universe) and lately I’ve been kinda obsessed with geography and maps.  
- 🌱 I’m currently working with **TypeScript (NestJS, Node.js)**, focusing on backend development and clean architecture. I’ve also worked with **Python** in the past 🐍, but nowadays my main stack is TypeScript.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **backend and full stack projects** that involve scalability, performance and good practices.  
- 📫 How to reach me: **natalia.armstronggg@gmail.com** or [@nataliaarmstrong23](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliaarmstrong23/) on LinkedIn.  
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I cry with emo music way more often than I’d like to admit...
