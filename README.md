- 👋 Hi, I’m @natalia-armstrong, but you can call me Nate (or Armstrong with you want to make me happy).
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, reading, listening to music (maybe much more than I should), playing guitar, playing some games, Lord of the rings (my all-time favorite fantasy universe) and right now I'm kinda obssessed with geografy in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java Script because I really want to be full stack developer, but I work with Python (mostly on backend) 🐍.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full stack projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: natalia.armstronggg@gmail.com or[ @nataliaarmstrong23](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliaarmstrong23/) on linkedin.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: To be honest, I cry with some emo music much more then I'm proud of...
